# landing_page
A landing page done with HTML and CSS

This project is a step up from the recipes project because it involves styling with CSS.  CSS is incredibly powerful in what it allows developers to do with websites and applications.  It can also drive you insane with how esoteric and complex it can be.  I've been using CSS for years and there have been so many moments of confusion and frustration from dealing with styling problems that I'd rather not think about it :sob:.  But here the CSS was pretty simple and the result looks nice.
